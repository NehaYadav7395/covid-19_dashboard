# üåç COVID-19 Global Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI

An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the spread, impact, and trends of COVID-19 globally using dynamic filters, forecast analytics, and comparative metrics.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Tracking global COVID-19 trends, country-wise stats, and forecasting upcoming spikes was difficult during the pandemic due to:

- Inconsistent data across sources.
- Lack of real-time visuals and forecasting.
- Inability to slice data by country, date, or metric category.

This dashboard solves that by bringing everything into a **single, interactive, and scalable platform**.
